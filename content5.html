                <p>
                    When you go on an outdoor adventure in a place like Bryce Canyon, it is possible to experience a depletion of your water supply. Or probably due to some circumstances you were forced to stay
                    outdoors longer than what you intended. Water in places like Bryce Canyon’s streams are not very safe to drink, so there is a need to purify it before you drink it. Nowadays, it becomes easier to purify water.
                    There are easy and simple ways how you can purify water that you will find along trails like the Navajo Loop and others to make it suitable for drinking purposes.
                    You can purify water by treating it with a chemical; either chlorine or iodine. You can also use filtration or ultraviolet light.
                    Another simple way is to boil the water. All of these methods are effective provided they are done properly. Anyway, you only need to choose one method that you are more comfortable with.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    1. Boiling<br>
                    This is a reliable way to purify water. However, boiling uses fuel and could take a while. Moreover, on summer days, it is not actually appealing to drink hot water. Furthermore, you will need to filter the water to
                    remove all solid particles especially if the water was taken from a doubtful; water source.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    2. Use of Iodine solution, tablets or crystals<br>
                    This is an effective and more convenient method. It is also available in different forms you will surely find one that would suit your budget. It has the ability to kill viruses and bacteria. They are lightweight and easy
                    to use. However, it takes about thirty minutes before you can drink the treated water. It is also not suitable for pregnant women. In addition, it has an aftertaste that you might not like. Once you drop the tablet into the water
                    container, shake the container and hold the bottle upside down and have the lid slightly unscrewed to let the iodine to flow into the threads of the bottle cap.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    3. Use chlorine drops<br>
                    Chlorine has the ability to kill bacteria in water. It is also lightweight, affordable, and easily accessible. You need to wait for thirty minutes before you can drink the treated water. You need to make sure not to put so many drops
                    as it could also be poisonous if used too much.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    4. Use water filter<br>
                    Water filters can remove bacteria in water. Carbon on the other hand gets rid of the chemicals and awful tastes while iodine coated screens can further remove viruses. Treated water can be consumed after the treatment and the water has
                    no bad taste. However, they are heavier than iodine or chlorine, more costly and needs manual pumping. Also, you will need to clean the filters after the activity and at some point; you will need to replace them after treating several gallons of water.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    5. Use Ultraviolet Light<br>
                    This looks similar to a small flashlight. You just swish it around in the water for a few minutes and the bacteria can already be killed. This is very easy to carry with you and so easy to use. However, you will need batteries to operate it and batteries
                    could run out. Moreover, the solid particles in the water are not filtered.
