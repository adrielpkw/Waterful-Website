                <h1> Eye-Opening Facts About Water</h1>
                <small>Date: 22/10/2020 By: Melissa Breyer</small>
                <p>
                    Water is deceptive. For while it pours freely from the heavens and seems to
                    flow endlessly in rivers, it’s a finite resource; we only have what we have.
                    And although there is about 332,500,000 cubic miles of it on earth, only one-hundredth of one percent of the world's water is readily available for human use.
                    We really need to learn how to show it some respect. Which is where World Water Day comes in. Even though water deserves celebration every day, we’ll take this
                    occasion to give a shout-out to this incredible compound that gives us life and sustains the planet around us. So with that in mind, consider the following facts
                    – some wondrous, some disconcerting, all eye-opening.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    1. Ninety-seven percent of the water on Earth is salt water; the water found in the Earth’s lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, swamps,
                    etcetera accounts for only 0.3 percent of the world’s fresh water. The rest is trapped in glaciers or is in the ground.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    2. Newborn babies have even more, ringing in at 78 percent water.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    3. A gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds; a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    4. The average human body is made of 50 to 65 percent water.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    5. Water covers 70.9 percent of the planet’s surface.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    6. It takes 2.6 gallons of water to make a sheet of paper.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    7. The World Health Organization recommends 2 gallons per person daily to
                    meet the requirements of most people under most conditions; and around 5 gallons per person daily to cover basic hygiene and food hygiene needs.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    8. 748 million people in the world do not have access to an improved source of drinking water.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    9. Since the average faucet releases 2 gallons of water per minute, you can save up to four gallons of water every morning by turning off the tap while you brush your teeth.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    10. More than one-quarter of all bottled water comes from a municipal water supply – the same place that tap water comes from.
