                <h1> After Wildfires Stop Burning, a Danger in the Drinking Water</h1>
                <small>Date: 2/10/2020 By: Max Horberry</small>
                <p> CALIFORNIA: Two months after a wildfire burned through Paradise, Calif., in 2018, Kevin Phillips, then a manager for town’s irrigation district,
                    walked from one destroyed home to another. Burned out cars, the occasional chimney and the melted skeletons of washers and dryers were
                    the only recognizable shapes. “You started to actually be shocked when you saw a standing structure,” he said.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Mr. Phillips, now Paradise’s town manager, was following the team taking samples from intact water meters connected to homes that were now
                    reduced to gray ash. He knew from the Tubbs Fire in 2017 that toxic chemicals were likely in the water distribution system: Rapid action would
                    be needed to protect people returning to the community from the dangers of substances like benzene, which can cause nausea and vomiting in the
                    short-term, or even cancer over time.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Wildfires, which turned skies a dim orange over cities from Seattle to Santa Cruz this year, are increasingly engulfing people’s homes, continuing
                    to rage in California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado in recent weeks. But even when homes don’t burn, other dangers arise in the aftermath, and
                    experts are focusing more attention on what happens to municipal water systems after a fire, when released toxic chemicals can get pulled into plumbing
                    systems, and other damage can linger in pipes for years.</p>
                <br>
                <p> After the fire that destroyed Paradise, for example, tests reported in a new study showed benzene levels in drinking water at 2,217 parts per billion.
                    The Tubbs Fire led to levels as high as 40,000 parts per billion. California health authorities say 1 part per billion is dangerous over the long-term,
                    and 26 parts per billion is dangerous for short-term exposure. And many other compounds that end up in water after fire can also create health risks. “It’s
                    hard enough having the pandemic restrictions,” said Angela Aurelia, a resident of Boulder Creek in Santa Cruz County, whose home was partially damaged
                    in August. “And then you have a wildfire, and you lose access to your home and then we can’t even go back home because the water isn’t likely safe to use.”</p>
                <br>
                <p>Mr. Phillips and some others who work to ensure the water flowing into homes is safe say they are following guidelines that are not designed for this kind of disaster.
                    After a fire, water in houses and in the underlying pipes “can become contaminated with an array of volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds” at
                    levels that exceed the regulatory limits set by the state of California as well as the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said Amisha Shah, a water quality engineer
                    at Purdue University. “It’s very clear it needs to be addressed.” Volatile organic compounds, such as benzene, naphthalene and methylene chloride, have a low boiling point
                    and can be dispersed into the air easily. Semi-volatiles, including chrysene and benzo(b)fluoranthene, have a higher boiling point but can be dispersed during, for example,
                    a warm shower. Although not all of these compounds are harmful, some have been found to cause cancer in the long term.</p>
                <p>Dr. Shah was a co-author of the study published in July by AWWA Water Science that summarized the lessons from the past few years. Analyzing sample data from the Tubbs Fire as
                    well as the Camp Fire that destroyed Paradise, the researchers found some of those harmful chemicals caused by wildfires throughout the distribution system. Earlier concern had
                    focused on ash runoff making its way into water sources, like reservoirs.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The researchers’ observations lined up with Mr. Phillips’s experience in Paradise two years ago. “Over 50 percent of those service lines from burned structures had some detection of
                    contamination,” he said. But he noticed there was a randomness to it. Water in one house would be contaminated, while the neighboring system would be clear. The state’s regulations
                    appeared inadequate to deal with a post-wildfire scenario, forcing Mr. Phillips and his team to effectively improvise their own standards. “We did go over and above what maybe the Water
                    Board would’ve required us to do,” he said. Had they not, he said, it might have taken years if not decades, to have clean drinking water again in the town.</p>
                <br>
                <p>How water moves through distribution systems, especially during a wildfire, is complex and needs more study. But Dr. Shah and the other authors of the research say that a loss in pressure,
                    which occurs when fires damage pipes, turns the plumbing into a vacuum that sucks smoke and other toxic chemicals out of burning homes. Those substances then get circulated throughout a community’s
                    water distribution system. It can even become worse, for example, when firefighters use a nearby hydrant, a necessary step that effectively encourages circulation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In addition to toxic substances becoming more widely dispersed from those charred buildings, plastic piping common in California’s mountainous areas releases chemicals when heated, melted or burned.
                    The study’s authors said such piping, even if it was not damaged, could absorb harmful chemicals passing through them that would leach into the water over a long period of time. In San Lorenzo Valley,
                    for example, 7.5 miles of high-density polyethylene pipes burned and were destroyed on Aug. 21. The over-ground pipes, which wound through a steep, heavily wooded mountain in Santa Cruz County, supplied
                    water to more than 21,000 residents.</p>
