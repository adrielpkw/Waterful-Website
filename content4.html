                <h1> Ways to save water</h1>
                <small>Date: 18/10/2020 By: Volusia County </small>
                <p>Next to air, water is the most important element for the preservation of life. Water is a finite commodity which,
                    if not managed properly, will result in shortages in the near future. Water conservation can go a long way to help
                    alleviate these impending shortages.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    1. Check your toilet for leaks.<br>
                    Put a few drops of food coloring in your toilet tank. If, without flushing, the coloring begins to appear in the bowl.,
                    you have a leak that may be wasting more than 100 gallons of water a day.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    2. Turn off the water while brushing your teeth.<br>
                    Before brushing, wet your brush and fill a glass for rinsing your mouth.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    3. Turn off the water while shaving.<br>
                    Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of warm water in which to rinse your razor.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    4. Tell your children not to play with the hose and sprinklers.<br>
                    Children love to play under a hose or sprinkler on a hot day. Unfortunately, this practice is extremely wasteful of precious water and should be discouraged.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    5. If you wash dishes by hand, don't leave the water running for rinsing.<br>
                    If you have two sinks, fill one with rinse water. If you have only one sink, first gather all your washed dishes in a dish rack, then rinse them quickly with a spray device or a pan of water.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    6. Turn off the water while shaving.<br>
                    Fill the bottom of the sink with a few inches of warm water in which to rinse your razor.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    7. Don't run the hose while washing your car.<br>
                    Soap down your car from a pail of soapy water. Use a hose only to rinse it off.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, water is very important for all lives on Earth. If one day, our water source has stopped supplying us water,
                    I wonder how we can continue living in this planet.
